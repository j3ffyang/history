# Simplified → Traditional (zh-hans → zh-hant)

Convert one Simplified-Chinese article into Traditional Chinese, and keep the pair in sync.

## Approval gate — read before anything else

- **Never convert or write without explicit user approval.** This skill converts on demand only; it does not run automatically and does not pick articles on its own.
- **Wait for the user to name the article.** If they don't, do nothing but ask which one.
- Before writing, confirm the plan: the source file, the exact output path, and whether an existing `-zh-hant.md` should be overwritten. **Never overwrite silently.**
- **Scope: future articles only.** Do not retrofit existing files (e.g. bare `YYMMDD-slug.md` or legacy `-chn.md`) unless the user explicitly orders it.

## Conventions

- **Filenames.** Simplified article = `docs/<YYMMDD-slug>-zh-hans.md`; Traditional twin = `docs/<YYMMDD-slug>-zh-hant.md`. (English articles stay bare or `-en`; the legacy `-chn` files are out of scope.)
- **Source of truth = the Simplified file.** The Traditional file is derived from it.
- **Traditional variant.** OpenCC `s2twp` (Taiwan, phrase-aware) — the best default for these literary articles.
- **Cross-link.** Exactly one line, directly under the H1 and above the infographic; Chinese label; a permanent absolute URL on the `j3ffyang` account:
  - In the Simplified file: `> 繁体版：[<simplified title>](https://github.com/j3ffyang/history/blob/main/docs/<slug>-zh-hant.md)`
  - In the Traditional file: `> 簡體版：[<traditional title>](https://github.com/j3ffyang/history/blob/main/docs/<slug>-zh-hans.md)`
  - The label is written in the file's own script (Simplified file → `繁体版`; Traditional file → `簡體版`) so neither file mixes scripts.
- **Infographic stays Simplified** and is shared by both files (same `../imgs/...` path). The README lists the Simplified article only.

## Procedure

1. **Wait for the user to name the article**, then locate `docs/<YYMMDD-slug>-zh-hans.md` (tolerate a bare `docs/<YYMMDD-slug>.md` as the Simplified source).
2. **Confirm the plan**: source path, output path (`-zh-hant.md`), and overwrite permission if the output already exists.
3. **If an existing `-zh-hant.md` is present**, stop and ask before overwriting — unless the user asked to update it.
4. **Run the sync script:**
   ```bash
   python3 .opencode/skills/simplified-to-traditional/scripts/sync_tra.py docs/<slug>-zh-hans.md
   ```
   It (a) injects/updates the Simplified file's `繁體版` cross-link, (b) converts the body with `opencc -c s2twp`, (c) injects the Traditional file's `简体版` cross-link, and (d) writes `docs/<slug>-zh-hant.md`.
5. **Review** the generated Traditional against the Simplified, and clear the script's lint. OpenCC can pick the wrong form for a 一简对多繁 character (see "OpenCC pitfalls" below) and can rewrite characters inside a quote. `sync_tra.py` prints a `⚠ … ambiguous form(s) to verify` list after every run — check each against the cited edition (or the intended meaning) and pin any genuine fix in `OVERRIDES`. Surface anything else suspicious to the user; do not silently hand-fix — a hand-edit is drift and will fail the next `--check`.
6. **Verify** the pair is in sync:
   ```bash
   python3 .opencode/skills/simplified-to-traditional/scripts/sync_tra.py docs/<slug>-zh-hans.md --check
   ```
   Exit 0 = in sync; exit 1 lists what is stale.
7. **Report**: source, output, and any review notes.

## Keeping the two in sync

- After editing the **Simplified** article, re-run the sync to refresh its Traditional twin.
- `--check` regenerates the Traditional in memory and diffs it against the file (ignoring the cross-link lines); non-zero exit means out of sync.
- **Do not treat the Traditional file as an editable primary.** Edit the Simplified and re-sync. If a term is genuinely mis-converted by OpenCC, tell the user and decide together, then pin it as a `(from, to)` pair in `scripts/sync_tra.py` → `OVERRIDES` — it is applied after OpenCC on every re-sync, so it survives (a hand-edit would not).

## OpenCC pitfalls (一简对多繁)

`opencc -c s2twp` is deterministic but context-blind: when one Simplified character maps to several Traditional ones, it can pick the wrong one for a rare, literary, or technical term. Two failure modes:

- **Ambiguous characters.** e.g. `云`（说）→ `雲`（cloud）; `干` → `乾`（dry）/ `幹`（do）. Rare TCM/literary terms err most. `sync_tra.py` prints a lint of every risky form（`雲 幹 髮 複 …`）after each run — verify each against the cited edition and pin a fix in `OVERRIDES` if wrong.
- **Register normalization.** `s2twp` may rewrite characters its Taiwan dictionary prefers（e.g. `哄`→`鬨`, `背`→`揹`）. Acceptable in running prose, but **wrong inside a verbatim quote** taken from another edition.

### Quotes must match the cited edition

Never delegate quoted primary text to a converter. For every verbatim quote, compare its Traditional characters with the edition named in the article's 引用来源; where `s2twp` differs, pin the `(from, to)` pair in `OVERRIDES`. Quoted text is otherwise frozen — do not change its characters or punctuation (§ AGENTS.md, "Verbatim-quote fidelity").

### Pinning fixes (`OVERRIDES`)

`OVERRIDES` in `sync_tra.py` is applied to the converted Traditional text after OpenCC, in order, on every re-sync. Add a pair only when OpenCC is genuinely wrong for this corpus; keep the list small and specific. Never hand-edit `-zh-hant.md` — a hand-edit is drift and fails `--check`.

## Verification checklist

- [ ] Traditional file exists at `docs/<slug>-zh-hant.md`.
- [ ] Both files carry the correct cross-link line directly under the H1 (Chinese label, `j3ffyang` URL, pointing at the other file).
- [ ] `sync_tra.py <source> --check` exits 0.
- [ ] The script's ambiguous-form lint was reviewed; genuine miscodings pinned in `OVERRIDES` (never hand-edited), and quotes verified against the cited edition.
- [ ] The infographic reference points at the shared (Simplified) image; no broken `../imgs/`.
- [ ] The Simplified file's body is otherwise unchanged (only the cross-link line added).
- [ ] Nothing committed (commit only on explicit approval).

## Error handling

- **Source not found**: list `docs/*-zh-hans.md` (and bare candidates) and ask which to use.
- **Output already exists**: stop and ask before overwriting.
- **`opencc` missing or wrong dict**: report and stop; do not guess a conversion.
- **Ambiguous source name** (neither `-zh-hans.md` nor a recognized `.md`): ask.
